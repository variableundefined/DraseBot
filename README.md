# DraseBot

A bot designed for a roleplay server I am involved in, in Discord.js. 

Come with basic functionalities for tracking characters in a database, along with a currency system. The main purpose is to track a character profile. 
The bot were built because all known bots out there with an economy system assume a 1 to 1 relationship between the player and their currency, while I needed to track 
multiple wallets belonging to a single player, independently. 

Uses Prisma ORM and PostgresSQL for Data.
